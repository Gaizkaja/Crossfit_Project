# CrossFit Box website

In this project the client asked us for an informative website to advertise their CrossFit services, with an intranet part to manage users in the gym and manage their messages. The project lasted two months, we started thinking about the general idea of the web, with a lot of information about the sport. The front end part is based on bootstrap with handmade javascript and the backend part we chose pure php. The database management was done with MySQL.
